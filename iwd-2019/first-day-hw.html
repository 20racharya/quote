	<h1><u>Barack Obama</u></h1>
	<p><b>The future rewards those who press on. I don't have time to feel sorry for myself. I don't have time to complain. I'm going to press on.</b>
	<br>
	<u>We proved that we are still a people capable of doing big things and tackling our biggest challenges.</u>
	<br>
	<i>What I'm asking for is hard. It's easier to be cynical; to accept that change isn't possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don't matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future.</i>
